The stakeholder map project aims to collect and share data on Digital Humanities (DH), Computational Social Sciences (CSS) and related activities and initiatives in South Africa. In the long run the map will include data related to:
- South African researchers;
- research and digitisation projects;
- publications;
- digital tools;
- available datasets;
- academic programmes; 
- regular training events;
- related programmes; 
- learning materials and more. 

The aim is to provide deeper insight into the breadth of activities in this area, to facilitate enhanced networking and collaboration, and support the optimal use of resources. The stakeholder map will, for example, support researchers looking for collaborators, help potential students to identify undergraduate and postgraduate training programmes, and highlight gaps and opportunities to funders and institutions.

The pipeline is primarily based on open-source software and platforms often used in the open science community. Data will be captured via Google Forms and manipulated using R scripts, available on GitHub and archived in Zenodo. Interactive visualisations will be published on the ESCALATOR website. These visualisations include a [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) that will allow the community to explore data through a web interface and a [Kumu network visualisation](https://kumu.io/). Research articles can be added to an [open collection in Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/3866799/dhcssza) to facilitate easy access to publications from the South African community.

### Status

The initial design of the data pipeline and workflow for data visualisation has been completed. Development is currently under way.
