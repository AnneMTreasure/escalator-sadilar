The first study group meetup for R and Python for Social Sciences/Humanities took place on 21 July 2021. There were seven participants at the meetup, two interested in learning R and five interested in learning Python. The discussion was lively as everyone talked about what they hope to learn, irrespective of the different mastery levels between everyone. We broke off into two groups, discussing the way forward and how they are planning to apply the skills they hope to learn.

When the groups rejoined, everyone had positive feedback whether it was about the help they received during the discussion or the excitement of hearing about other participants&#39; plans. It is really encouraging to be part of a community where one can learn, discuss and get help while not feeling any pressure to know more than you know. There is no set learning plan or course in these groups, so you can fall in when there&#39;s a meetup and bring your own data and workshop it yourself or/and with other participants! Be sure to join our next meetup that is scheduled for Wednesday, 4 August 2021 at 10:00-12:00 SAST.

See the previous blogs about the [Python study group](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-06-python-study-group/) and the [R study group](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-08-r-study-group/). To get involved or learn more, please join our DHCSSza Slack workspace and specifically mention that you&#39;re interested in Python and/or R, or directly join the #learning-python or #learning-r channel.
