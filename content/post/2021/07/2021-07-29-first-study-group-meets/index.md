> South Africa commemorates Women’s Month in August as a tribute to the more than 20 000 women who marched to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956 in protest against the extension of Pass Laws to women. The Government of South Africa declared August Women’s Month and 9 August is celebrated annually as Women’s Day. ([https://www.gov.za/womens-month](https://www.gov.za/womens-month))


This year, ESCALATOR is celebrating Women’s Month by launching the [EMPOWER track](https://escalator.sadilar.org/champions/empower) of the [Digital Champions Initiative](https://escalator.sadilar.org/champions/overview). To start off, EMPOWER will offer a series of events under the title “Finding your place in an increasingly digital world as a woman in Humanities or Social Sciences”. The events are open to women affiliated with South African research and academic institutes at all career stages and with any level of digital or technical experience. 

The series aims to show women in Humanities and Social Sciences why they need to become part of the tech conversation, use technology, how they can learn and grow, and where they can get support. We’ll specifically showcase communities that are dedicated to growing inclusivity and diversity in technology such as [WanaData](https://medium.com/wanadata-africa), [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), and [Youthmappers](https://www.youthmappers.org/). Our speakers also include technology practitioners within diverse research fields such as education, anthropology, international relations studies, and psychology.

According to a report from 2018 published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) titled “[BRIDGING THE DIGITAL GENDER DIVIDE INCLUDE, UPSKILL, INNOVATE](https://www.oecd.org/digital/bridging-the-digital-gender-divide.pdf)” (2018), women are still far less likely to use technology. In the foreword, the authors say the following:

> Today the digital transformation provides new avenues for the economic empowerment of women and can contribute to greater gender equality. The Internet, digital platforms, mobile phones and digital financial services offer “leapfrog” opportunities for all and can help bridge the divide by giving women the possibility to earn additional income, increase their employment opportunities, and access knowledge and general information. We need to seize this opportunity to foster greater gender equality in the labour market, boost economic growth and build a more inclusive, digital world.

And building a more inclusive digital world is precisely one of the big aims of the [ESCALATOR programme](https://escalator.sadilar.org). The Digital Champions Initiative, a flagship activity of ESCALATOR, is a six-track mentorship programme to support Humanities and Social Sciences researchers in their digital and computational journeys. The six tracks are all aimed at different audiences with the EMPOWER track specifically focussing on supporting women.

The EMPOWER track was launched on 5 August with presentations for the first session looking at “How Stories Breathe: A Digital Perspective”. During the event, our two speakers shared their own experience with digital storytelling.

She’s also a researcher and lecturer. Candice’s talk focussed on how they are using digital storytelling as part of the curriculum to help students connect with content and learn digital storytelling as methodology.
