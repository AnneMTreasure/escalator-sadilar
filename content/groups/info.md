In the earliest phase of the ESCALATOR programme working groups will be established that are directly linked to programme deliverables. Initially these working groups will focus on:
- [development of the champions programme](../champions)
- [monitoring and evaluation of the ESCALATOR programme](../monitor)
- [mapping the landscape of stakeholders and training initiatives](../initiatives) for digital humanities and computational social science in South Africa.

Please join these working groups if you are keen to contribute at the earliest stage of the programme.

Later on there will be opportunities for stakeholders to suggest and establish new working groups based on gaps and opportunities identified.

For more information about the working groups or if you'd like to join an existing group, please email [escalator@talarify.co.za](mailto:escalator@talarify.co.za).
