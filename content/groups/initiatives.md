title: "Working group: Stakeholders & Training Initiatives"
subtitle: "Who is part of the community and where is training available?"

---

One of the first activities ESCALATOR is focussing on, is to understand the role players in the field of digital humanities and computational social sciences in South Africa. We want to learn who are offering training opportunities, what work is being done, where are the gaps in terms of the training offerings, and more. With this information in hand, we will know what to focus on, how to bring people with shared interests together, where our country's strengths lie and where we still need help from international peers.

One of the outputs of this working group will be a [list of training initiatives and communities](../../initiatives) on the ESCALATOR website.

We will also encourage South Africans to contribute their training programme information to the international [Digital Humanities Course Registry](https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/info) to create more awareness.

Finally we will create a social graph to visualise the landscape using [Kumu](https://kumu.io/).
