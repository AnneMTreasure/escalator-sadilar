subtitle: "Growing leaders through mentorship"

---

The working group will focus on the development and implementation of the Digital Humanities/Computational Social Sciences Champions programme.

Based on the ESCALATOR project plan, we will develop a mentorship programme for researchers from any career stage wanting to become a leader at their organisation in terms of digital and computational research methods. The programme will be rolled out in various phases:
- development of the mentorship programme including:
    (i) a programme for equipping mentors; and 
    (ii) programme for empowering mentees
- first intake of mentors
- first intake of mentees
- reflect on first intakes and adjust programme based on lessons learned
- second intake of mentors
- second intake of mentees
- reflect on second intakes and report on lessons learned for future programmes.
