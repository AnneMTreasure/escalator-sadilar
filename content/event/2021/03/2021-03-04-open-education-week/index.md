summary: This short presentation will briefly introduce the South African Centre for Digital Language Resources and the ESCALATOR programme with specific focus on plans for developing contextualised training materials and a mentorship programme. 

abstract: Humanities and Social Sciences research and education are in dire need of strong coordinated interventions to enable the pervasive adoption of digital research methodologies and practices. Over the past few years several capacity development initiatives were implemented within various institutions and communities, but South Africa still lacks a national, integrated active community of practice in this space.In order to ensure large-scale adoption of digital research methodologies and practices within Social Sciences and Humanities, the South African Centre forDigital Language Resources (SADiLaR) established the ESCALATOR programme. ESCALATOR will consist of a national digital champions programme in combination with an orchestrated capacity development and awareness raising initiative.
