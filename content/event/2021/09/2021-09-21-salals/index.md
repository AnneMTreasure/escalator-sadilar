summary: The annual conference of the Southern African Linguistics and Applied Linguistics Society (SALALS), with participation by the South African Association of Language Teachers (SAALT), will be hosted in 2021 by the Department of General Linguistics at Stellenbosch University with support from the South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR).  

abstract: "The aim, first and foremost, is to make the 2021 conference as accessible and multilingual as possible. In order to do this, the conference will take the following format:

Papers and posters will be pre-recorded by presenters and all presentation materials, including slides/posters and videos, will be hosted on the conferenceâ€™s Open Science Framework page prior to the conference. Papers/posters can be in any of the South African official languages, as well as South African Sign Language (SASL). Pre-recorded presentations in languages other than English will be provided with English closed captions/subtitles, while papers related to sign language linguistics will be interpreted into/from SASL.

In addition to the pre-recorded presentations, the conference will consist of live events via Zoom, including keynote presentations, panel sessions, Q&A sessions for the general session presentations and posters, and social events."
