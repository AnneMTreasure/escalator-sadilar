summary: The 10th WOCAL will take place at Leiden University, June 7-12, 2021. The conference theme is African languages for sustainable societies and knowledge creation. The World Congress of African Linguistics is the only truly international and pan-theoretical conference in the field of African Linguistics, with a strong emphasis on the participation of African scholars.   

abstract: "Language plays a vital role in our societies that are more and more shaped by communication and information, and Africa is no exception. As languages provide the framework for interpreting the world, African languages can contribute tremendously to our understanding of how people communicate and how language structures this interaction. Only by using African languages in all spheres of social life in African societies does communication become inclusive and information truly accessible to all and lead to reducing  inequality and establishing  sustainable societies. African linguistics has a key role to play in helping to bring this about.
We invite contributions on all African languages including sign languages; synchronic and diachronic studies, literatures in African languages; all subdisciplines of linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, psycholinguistics, language planning and policy, language documentation; and applied and educational linguistics."
