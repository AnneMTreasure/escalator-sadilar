summary: All in-person courses, workshops, and featured speakers originally scheduled for DHSI 2020 and DHSI 2021 have been postponed to 2022 due to COVID-19, but weâ€™re thrilled to be hosting several (free!) virtual offerings this June (7-11 & 14-18), including aligned conferences & events, online workshops, and institute lectures.  

abstract: "The Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) is an annual digital scholarship training institute that takes place at the University of Victoria. Around 800-900 participants attend DHSI, and its extended pedagogical partnership includes some 30 institutions and academic organizations plus an expanding international training network. DHSI is a community-based environment for discussing and learning about new technologies and how they influence teaching, research, creation, and preservation in different disciplines. DHSI is a Canadian Social Knowledge Institute (C-SKI; c-ski.ca) training institute.

A time of intensive coursework, seminars, and lectures, participants at DHSI share ideas and methods as well as develop expertise in advanced technologies. Every summer, DHSI brings together faculty, staff, and students from the arts, humanities, library, and archives communities as well as independent scholars and participants from areas beyond. DHSI is coordinated by the Canadian Social Knowledge Institute at UVic."
