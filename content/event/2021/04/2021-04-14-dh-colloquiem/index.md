summary: This presentation will look at historical examples of digital editions focusing on the pioneering work of the Canterbury Tales Project. 

abstract: This presentation will look at historical examples of digital editions focusing on the pioneering work of the Canterbury Tales Project but also looking at examples from Italian and Spanish traditions. Barbara Bordalejo draws on her experience encoding primary textual sources for textual critical purposes to present the evolution of encoding systems to reflect textual layering within single documents. The editorial process, starting from transcription, and going through collation optimization, computer-assisted stemmatology, analysis and culminating on editing is exemplified with Textual Communities. Bordalejo will also show how editors are taking advantage of new ways of distributing scholarly work in mobile devices and the important lessons about the difference between presenting editions for specialized audiences or the general public.
