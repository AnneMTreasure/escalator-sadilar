summary: Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

abstract: This online workshop will introduce participants to concepts of data organisation in spreadsheets as well as data cleaning using the free and opensource tool, OpenRefine. Participants will also learn how to use the free and opensource R language for data analysis and visualisation. The event is organised by the University of the Western Cape and sponsored by [SADiLaR](https://www.sadilar.org/index.php/en/).
