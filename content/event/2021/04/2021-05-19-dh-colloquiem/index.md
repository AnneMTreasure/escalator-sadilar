summary: This presentation discusses how the academe and African scholars can explore new technologies to recalibrate their research endeavours and impact.

abstract: The increasing interpenetration of computer science and technology with other disciplines outside the natural sciences has continued to accentuate the increasing importance of the digital transformation impacting our lives and society. Digital Humanities (DH), an emerging off shoot of this global digital revolution, espouses the deployment of new tools and techniques to retool humanistic scholarship and increase the use of social and cultural data for regional and global development. This presentation discusses how the academe and African scholars can explore new technologies to recalibrate their research endeavours and impact. Despite some perceived challenges, it is argued that these new approaches can reinvent, reconfigure and galvanize research and social transformation in Africa.
