### WHAT

The Enhancer track will give participants an opportunity to hone their digital and computational research skills with application to a current research project. Participants will have an opportunity to work one-on-one or in small groups with a mentor to learn more advanced techniques, tools, or practices in Digital Humanities or Computational Social Sciences.

The track is still under development, but we want to highlight other existing opportunities:
- [The Open Life Science Mentorship Programme](https://openlifesci.org/) (not only for life scientists but recently included projects related to Natural Language processing and other social science/humanities projects)
- [Deep Learning Indaba Mentorship Programme](https://deeplearningindaba.com/mentorship/)

### WHO

Researchers, students, and support staff who are already familiar with concepts related to digital and computational research will be prioritised. Participants will have to show that they will get support for joining this track via their supervisors or departments.
