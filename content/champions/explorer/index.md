### WHAT

This track will be a primer offering a glimpse of what people can expect to encounter in the community and via other Digital Champions Initiative tracks. The track will have limited contact sessions, but will offer various compilations of short video clips introducing concepts like:
- Digital Humanities
- Open Science
- Reproducibility in research
- Digital Scholarship
- and more...

Participants will be encouraged to [join our Slack Workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) to get to know the community and gain exposure to conversations about digital and computational research in the humanities and social sciences.

### WHO

The Explorer track will be open to anyone starting out with digital scholarship. There will be no limit on the number of participants. 
__No previous experience with digital scholarship or computational research required__. We welcome anyone interested to learn more!

### CONTENT

We will shortly start sharing relevant content here.
