### WHAT

This track is a primer, offering a glimpse of what people can expect to encounter in the community and via other Digital Champions Initiative tracks. The track offers a range of curated video play lists and one scheduled contact session per month. The contact session is an informal meetup and discussion session open to people whom have watched the videos and have questions about anything related to the topics as well as anyone interested to learn more about ESCALATOR and the Digital Champions Initiative. To sign up for an upcoming meetup, please add your name to our [open meetup document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdE9s8_fmwBTgCBRsGk1CiRR0YBymhX_adX9inPDu9I/edit?usp=sharing).

Participants are encouraged to [join our Slack Workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) to get to know the community and gain exposure to conversations about digital and computational research in the humanities and social sciences. Questions and discussions related to the video content from our Explorer's Playlists can be asked on the #dci-explorer-track Slack channel specifically.

### WHO

The Explorer track is open to anyone starting out with digital scholarship. There is no limit on the number of participants. 
__No previous experience with digital scholarship or computational research required__. We welcome anyone interested to learn more!

### CONTENT

Many of the topics listed below are tightly connected to each other and you'll find that some of the categories are a bit cosmetic. We hope that by creating these different playlists, newcomers to digital and computational research will find it easier to compile a big picture of what it all entails.

These playlists are under constant development. If you would like to include suggest other topics to include or know of good video clips that illustrate these concepts well (especially video clips with an African or South African focus), please [let us know](../../contact).
